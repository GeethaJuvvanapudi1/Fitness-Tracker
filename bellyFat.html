    <h1>DIET TIPS TO REDUCE BELLY FAT</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Eat plenty of soluble fiber: Foods rich in soluble fiber include oats, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Soluble fiber may help reduce belly fat by increasing fullness and reducing calorie absorption.</li>
      <li>Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages: Sugary drinks like soda and fruit juices can contribute to belly fat. Opt for water, unsweetened tea, or coffee instead.</li>
      <li>Limit refined carbs: Minimize your intake of refined carbohydrates like white bread, pastries, and processed foods. These foods can lead to spikes in blood sugar and increase belly fat.</li>
      <li>Include healthy fats in your diet: Choose sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These fats can help you feel full and may reduce belly fat.</li>
      <li>Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help boost metabolism and reduce feelings of hunger, aiding in weight loss.</li>
    </ul>
